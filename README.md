# Venturus-Sports-Project

# Running the project

This project was done using ReactJs. To run the project, it´s good to follow the instructions. Be sure to have installed the latest versions of Node.js, Node Express and npm. Follow the step-by-step:
  - Download the "Servidor Node" folder;
  - Using terminal, enter "Servidor Node" folder and execute the command "node Server.js". (this will put a node server to run locally so you will be able to run the project);
  - Open you favorite web browser and type "localhost:9000";
  - Enjoy!

# Running the project in dev mode

To run the project in dev mode, we are going to use create-react-app to do it. Be sure to have installed the latest versions of Node.js and npm. Follow the step-by-step:
  - Download the "cdc-admin - Copy" folder;
  - Using terminal, enter "cdc-admin - Copy" folder. There you will see that it doesn´t have a "node_modules" folder, and we need that to run the create-react-app. To do it, execute "npm install create-react-app" and it will be installed locally.
  - After installation process, execute "npm start". It will open the project in your default browser;
  - To see the code, open the files in a text editor of your choice. I recommend Atom.
#  - Enjoy!
